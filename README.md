# Fraud Academy OS v1.0

Fraud Academy OS is a fictional fraud investigation training operating system. It teaches investigators how to think through cases, connect evidence, document findings, and make defensible decisions using training-safe fictional data.

## Source of truth

The locked product compass now lives in:

```text
docs/FRAUD_ACADEMY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md
```

Use that file before making architecture, UI, tool, scenario, or Evidence First changes.

## Locked direction

- One Case. One Workspace. One Investigation.
- Every tool answers one investigator question.
- Evidence First: no fraud/non-fraud answer, fraud score, red flags, green flags, AI recommendation, or decision hint before the investigation is complete.
- Summaries assist. Event logs verify.
- Search finds evidence. Link Analysis connects evidence.
- Luna can encourage before submission, but Luna debrief and scoring only happen after submission.
- Mobile feels like a magical investigator notebook.
- Desktop feels like a fraud command center.

## Wave 1 build

## Next waves

## Wave 1 test status

The repo has been updated through the GitHub connector. Local build testing still needs to be run in a connected development environment because this execution runtime could not resolve github.com for cloning.
